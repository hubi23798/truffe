# Vercel Cutover Runbook

## Prerequisites
- Vercel project `truffe` imported from repo, all env vars set (see `.env.example`)
- Supabase project `truffe-us` live and migrations applied
- Production branch: `main`. Preview branches: all.

## Steps

### 1. Verify preview deploy
Confirm latest `main` preview deploy on Vercel is green (build + all checks pass).

### 2. Take Fly snapshot
Record Fly.io production traffic state: active connections, volume mounts, last deploy SHA.

### 3. Update DNS
Change DNS CNAME from Fly app (`truffe-ai.fly.dev`) to Vercel project URL.
Set TTL to 300s (5 min) before the cutover window for fast propagation.

### 4. Monitor (first 30 min)
- Vercel: Functions → Execution log, error rate
- Supabase: Database → Connections (watch Supavisor pool utilization)
- Axiom: error event count vs baseline
- Vercel: Functions → Execution duration (p95 should be < 2s for API routes)

### 5. Smoke test
Log in as primary user. Verify:
- Dashboard loads with accounts and net worth
- Transactions page renders
- Advisor responds to a message
- Logout works

### 6. Hold Fly warm (24h)
Keep Fly app running for 24h for instant rollback. Do NOT scale it down.

## Rollback
Revert DNS CNAME back to Fly app URL. TTL 300 means max 5-min exposure after rollback.

## Post-cutover cleanup (after 24h soak)
```bash
mkdir -p docs/archive/fly
git mv Dockerfile fly.toml docker-compose.yml docs/archive/fly/ 2>/dev/null || true
git commit -m "chore(deploy): archive Fly.io artifacts post-Vercel cutover"
```
